# Brief instructions to run the benchmark

To run the benchmark, follow these brief instructions:

1. As the file contains both text and code sections, the entire notebook must be run. Click on 'Runtime' and then select 'Run all'. At the end of the notebook, figures showing the main results will be displayed.

2. To program disturbances in the model, navigate to the 'Calculation' section. In the first lines of this section, you can program disturbances in the relative humidity, temperature, and pressure of the air entering the assembly. By default, these disturbances are programmed at 3000 seconds of simulation time with a value of 1.0, indicating no disturbance. Modify this value as needed. For example, use 1.10 to introduce a +10% step disturbance on the respective variable.

3. To change the default simulation time of 6000 seconds, navigate to the 'Total simulation time' section of the notebook.
